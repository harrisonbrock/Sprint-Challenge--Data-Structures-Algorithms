Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method? O(n) all node are visited

2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?  O(h) is based on the height of the tree

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?  O(n) all node are visited

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? O(w) is base on the width of the tree

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? O(n * lg(n))

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function?  O(n * m) we have to create second array

Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
We could do it in O(n)
